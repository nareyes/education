# Exam Perspective

## PolyBase 
6 steps are very important. You should remember all 6 steps in sequence. You will get a question, where you will be given many steps, and you will have to choose the right steps and put those steps in sequence.

1. Extract the source data into text files
2. Land the data into Azure Blob Storage or ADLS Gen2 Storage
3. Prepare the data for loading
4. Load the data into dedicated SQL pool staging tables using PolyBase
5. Transform the data
6. Insert the date into production tables

## Azure SQL Data Warehouse
Data distribution is very important. You should have a clear understanding about three distribution methods. Scenarios will be given, and you will be asked to choose the right distribution method.

- Replicate
- Hash
- Round Robin

Geo-replication was removed from the syllabus on July 31, 2020. But even after that questions are coming based on this concept, maybe Microsoft has not updated their test yet.

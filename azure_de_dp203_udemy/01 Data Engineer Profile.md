### Data Engineer Roles, Responsibilities, and Technologies
> Understanding the data engineer role requires an understanding of the data life cycle, and how data flows through modern data architecture.

##### Data Life Cycle
- Ingest
- Explore
- Prep & Train
- Model & Serve

##### Roles & Responsibilities
- Data Engineers contribute to roughly 80% of the Data Life Cycle, while Data Analyst and Data Scientist mainly contribute to the tail-end of the life cycle (BI/Reporting, Real-Time and Advanced Analytics). 
- Data Engineers ensure the smooth flow of data from source to destination, and build the foundation for historic and predictive analytics. 

- Key questions for Data Engineer's;
	- What are the sources of data?
	- What is the format of source data?
	- How would I transform this data?
	- What is the destination of this data?
	- What question does this data need to answer?

##### Data Engineer Technologies

##### Data Engineering Pipeline Processing
- **Source**: Identify the source systems to extract from.
- **Ingest**: Identify the technology and method to ingest the data.
- **Prepare**: Identify the technology and method to transform/prepare data.
- **Analyze**: Identify the technology and method to analyze the data.
- **Consume**: Identify the technology to consume/present data.
